    "In Ridge Regression, the regression coefficients are penalized by a factor proportional to the tuning parameter (lambda) and the L2 norm of the coefficient vector. This penalty has the effect of shrinking the magnitude of the coefficients towards zero, which reduces their sensitivity to changes in the input data. The coefficients that are not shrunk to zero can be interpreted in the same way as the coefficients in OLS regression. That is, the sign and magnitude of the coefficient indicate the direction and strength of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",

    "The magnitude of the coefficients in Ridge Regression reflects the tradeoff between bias and variance. A larger value of lambda will result in a greater amount of shrinkage and a smaller magnitude of the coefficients.

A smaller value of lambda will result in less shrinkage and a larger magnitude of the coefficients, which can lead to a less biased model but with higher variance and more sensitivity to changes in the input data.\n",
