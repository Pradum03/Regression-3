    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 Regularization, is a linear regression technique used for feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the model penalizes the absolute value of the coefficients, forcing some of them to shrink towards zero, effectively performing feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero. This makes Lasso Regression useful for dealing with high-dimensional datasets where there may be many features that are not relevant to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression tends to produce sparser models, with fewer non-zero coefficients. In Ridge Regression, the model penalizes the square of the coefficients, which results in smaller but non-zero coefficients for all features.\n",

    "Lasso Regression also differs from Elastic Net Regression, which is a combination of both Lasso and Ridge Regression. Elastic Net Regression uses a linear combination of L1 and L2 penalties, allowing for both feature selection and shrinkage of non-zero coefficients."

    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is that it can automatically identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model by setting their coefficients to zero. This leads to simpler and more interpretable models, which are less prone to overfitting and better able to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In high-dimensional datasets where there are many features, Lasso Regression can be particularly useful for selecting a subset of relevant features that are most predictive of the target variable. This can improve the performance of the model by reducing noise and improving its ability to capture the underlying relationships between the features and the target variable.\n",

    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, also known as the \"lambda\" parameter, which controls the strength of the L1 penalty applied to the coefficients. Increasing the value of lambda increases the penalty and results in more coefficients being set to zero, leading to a sparser model with fewer features. Decreasing the value of lambda decreases the penalty and allows more features to be included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another related parameter is the alpha parameter, which controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties in Elastic Net Regression. Alpha values of 1 correspond to pure Lasso Regression, while alpha values of 0 correspond to pure Ridge Regression. Intermediate values of alpha provide a trade-off between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the optimal lambda and alpha values depends on the specific dataset and problem being addressed. It's common to use cross-validation techniques to select the best tuning parameters by testing different combinations of lambda and alpha values and selecting the values that produce the best performance on a validation set. It's also important to keep in mind that the optimal tuning parameters may vary depending on the size of the dataset, the number of features, and the level of noise in the data."

However, it is possible to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems by introducing non-linear transformations of the features.\n",

    "One common approach is to apply a non-linear transformation to the features before fitting the Lasso Regression model. For example, the features may be transformed using polynomial functions, logarithmic functions, or other non-linear functions. These transformed features can then be used as inputs to the Lasso Regression model, allowing it to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.\n",

    "However, it's important to note that the complexity of the model may increase significantly with the introduction of non-linear transformations or kernel functions, and this may increase the risk of overfitting.

Lasso Regression, on the other hand, applies an L1 penalty to the coefficients, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients.\n",

In contrast, Lasso Regression may select one of the correlated features and set the coefficients of the others to zero.\n",

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by shrinking the coefficients of the correlated features towards zero. When two or more features in the dataset are highly correlated with each other, it can be difficult to determine which feature is most important for predicting the target variable. Lasso Regression addresses this problem by adding an L1 penalty term to the regression objective function, which encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L1 penalty term in the Lasso Regression objective function can cause some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the impact of the correlated features on the model. By setting some of the coefficients to zero, Lasso Regression effectively chooses one of the correlated features and sets the coefficients of the others to zero, thus reducing the impact of multicollinearity in the data.\n",

    "However, it's important to note that Lasso Regression can sometimes lead to unstable and inconsistent coefficient estimates when the degree of multicollinearity is high, especially when the number of features is large. In such cases, it may be necessary to use other techniques such as Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, or Principal Component Regression to handle multicollinearity more effectively."
